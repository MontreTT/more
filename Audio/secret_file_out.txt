She sold my soul
But I can make it all right
She told no more
And I cannot breathe at night
You killed me my girl
How you expect me to feel?
You took me my life
And everything I need

She sold my soul
And there is no change of mind
She told don't cry
Don't need you by my side

If only I
Could read again
What's on your mind
You let me go
You let me die into the sun
Empty head
I'm playin' dead
Is this the end?
I'm paying for
Those things I said
I'm sorry babe

Hear me now
I'm screaming loud
Live your life
Do what you want
Turn your back
And look no more
I'll sing this song
With all my soul

I'm feelin' dead
I'll burn the sun
I'll cut me down
I'll let my self
To feel the end
To give you strength

I feel the end
I'll burn the sun
I'll let me go
I'm waiting 'till
The end of days
For you again

People are telling me how blank is the world
Freedom is giving me now the soul that I sold
I am a son of a gun I'm shooting my life
You're gonna see the one, the one you don't like

Heaven rejects me and throws me back
I am forgotten I live in the dark
I'm smoking woods and I'm sniffin' the clouds
I am the name that nobody shouts
The skin of my mother is under my veins
I feel so empty I got no remains
The voice of my father is so long and gone
I am the son of a loaded gun

Happiness is full of lies I'm killing my dreams
I'm speaking and everything dies I wake up in screams
Emptiness sparks in the light watching you fade
Please don't give up the fight follow your fate

Heaven rejects me and throws me back
I am forgotten I live in the dark
I'm smoking woods and I'm sniffin' the clouds
I am the name that nobody shouts
The skin of my mother is under my veins
I feel so empty I got no remains
The voice of my father is so long and gone
I am the son I am a gun

Proud of my name, my feels, all of me
Proud to be the one that you spit
Love me or let me breathe in my sleep
Love me or let me breathe in my sleep

We are the ones that live in your dream
Proud to be the ones that you spit
Love me or let me breathe in my sleep
Proud of my name, my feels, all of me

We are the dogs that live in despair
We are the gods, the kings of nowhere
We are the dogs that live in despair

We are the dogs that live in despair
We are the gods, the kings of nowhere
Follow the kids that don't give a damn
Tame the ones that give you the spell
We are the gods, the kings of nowhere
We are the dogs that live in despair

We are the gods, the kings of nowhere
We are the dogs that live in despair
We are the gods, the kings of nowhere
